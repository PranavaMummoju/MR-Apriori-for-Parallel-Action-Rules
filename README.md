# MR-Apriori-for-Parallel-Action-Rules
Apriori Algorithm has been implemented in Distribute environment (University Hadoop research cluster) using Hadoop MapReduce paradigm, to extract Association Action Rules. Unlike other algorithms generating Action Rules, this algorithm does not require any prior classification rules to generate the Action Rules.
